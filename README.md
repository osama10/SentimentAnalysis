# SentimentAnalysis
Perform Sentiment Analysis using neural networks . The accuracy is not good as the dataset is not large.
The project contains two python files i.e Create_Sentiment_Featureset and Sentiment_Neural_Networks.

# Create_Sentiment_Featureset
This is use for preprocessing of data. I have used nltk for this.

# Sentiment_Neural_Networks
This is the neural nets use for the sentiment analysis . I have use 3 layer neural network with batch size = 100

# The Data Set
The dataset contains two text files . 
(1) pos.txt :- It contains the positive sentiments
(2) neg.txt :- It contains the negative sentiments 

The dataset can be downloaded from my google drive https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9H6sPCq9rDARmRHT2xQYVc5ajA . 
Please copy them in the project file before running the code.
